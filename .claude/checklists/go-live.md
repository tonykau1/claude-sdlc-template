## üö¶ Go/No-Go Decision

### ‚úÖ GREEN - DEPLOY
All critical items checked, minor issues documented and acceptable

### üü° YELLOW - PROCEED WITH CAUTION
Some non-critical items outstanding, but risks mitigated

### üî¥ RED - DO NOT DEPLOY
Critical issues present, deployment would risk production

## üìã Deployment Day Checklist

### 30 Minutes Before
- [ ] All code merged and tagged
- [ ] Team assembled (dev, ops, product)

- Customer-facing critical issue

**Consider rollback if:**
- Multiple non-critical bugs
- User complaints spike

- [ ] User feedback positive
- [ ] Business metrics trending up

## üìù Post-Launch Tasks

After deployment:
1. Send success announcement
2. Update documentation
3. Close related tickets
4. Schedule retrospective
5. Plan next iteration
6. Monitor for one week
7. Write blog post (if applicable)
8. Thank the team!

## üí° Pro Tips

**Best practices for launches:**
- Deploy during low-traffic hours
- Never deploy on Friday (unless critical)
- Have team available post-deployment
- Start with small % rollout if possible
- Celebrate wins, learn from issues

**Red flags to watch:**
- Spike in error rates
- Sudden increase in response times
- Database connection issues
- Memory leaks appearing
- User complaints increasing

## üéì Lessons Learned

After launch, document:
- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- What was unexpected?
- What would we do differently?
- What tools/processes helped?

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Monitor for stability
2. Gather user feedback
3. Plan iterations
4. Document learnings
5. Improve process for next time
