## üö® Red Flags - Stop Deployment If:

- Authentication can be bypassed
- Users can access others' data
- Secrets exposed in code or logs
- SQL injection possible
- XSS vulnerabilities present
- Critical dependencies have known CVEs
- No rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- HTTPS not enforced

## üí° Security Mindset

**Think like an attacker:**
- What would I try if I wanted to break this?
- What's the worst that could happen?
- Who would want to attack this and why?
- What data is most valuable to protect?

**Defense in depth:**
- Never rely on a single security control
- Assume outer layers will fail
- Multiple layers of protection
