## Development Workflow

### Before Starting Any Feature
1. Review [pre-feature checklist](_template/checklists/pre-feature-start.md)
2. Understand requirements - ask clarifying questions
3. Document in `project/features/[feature-name]/requirements.md`
4. Create Architecture Decision Record if needed (for significant decisions)
5. Create feature branch: `feature/[feature-name]` or `hotfix/[fix-name]`

### During Development
1. Follow [code standards](project/standards/code-style.md)
2. **Test-driven development**: Write tests alongside code
3. **Separate concerns**: Keep business logic separate from display logic
4. **Security mindset**: Think like a pentester - what could go wrong?
5. **Document as you go**: Complex logic needs comments explaining "why"
6. **Interactive process**: Ask questions, don't assume

### Before Committing
1. Run through [pre-commit checklist](_template/checklists/pre-commit.md)
2. Run linter: `[your lint command]`
3. Run tests: `[your test command]`
4. Fix all warnings and errors
5. Review your own diff
6. Write clear commit message (follow Conventional Commits)

### Before Merging to Main
1. Complete [pre-merge checklist](_template/checklists/pre-merge.md)
2. Ensure all CI checks pass
3. Get required code reviews
4. Test in staging environment (if applicable)
5. Update CHANGELOG if needed
6. Squash commits if appropriate

## Specialized Agents

When you need focused expertise, reference these agents:

- **[Architect](_template/agents/architect.md)**: Architecture decisions, system design, scalability, ADRs
- **[Security](_template/agents/security.md)**: Security reviews, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment
- **[Backend](_template/agents/backend.md)**: API design, business logic, database optimization, performance
- **[Frontend](_template/agents/frontend.md)**: UI/UX, accessibility, responsive design, component architecture
- **[DevOps](_template/agents/devops.md)**: Infrastructure, deployment, monitoring, CI/CD pipelines
- **[QA](_template/agents/qa.md)**: Testing strategy, test coverage, quality assurance processes

## Agent Autonomy Settings

**Choose your workflow mode** by uncommenting one of the options below:

### Option 1: YOLO Mode (Autonomous) - RECOMMENDED FOR ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

**Enabled by default.** Work autonomously without asking for approval except for destructive operations.

**✅ Auto-approved operations** (just do it, report results):
- Create/edit files and directories
- Install dependencies (npm, pip, cargo, etc.)
- Run tests, linters, formatters
- Run builds and dev servers
- SELECT queries (read-only database)
- Git add, commit, push to feature branches
- Web research and documentation lookups
- Start/stop development processes

**❌ Requires explicit approval**:
- Delete files/directories
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DROP database operations (except test DB)
- git push --force, git reset --hard
- Push to main/master branch
- System-level installs (sudo)
- Production deployments

**Workflow**: Just do the work, then report what you did. Don't ask "Should I...?" unless it's destructive.

**See**: [YOLO Mode Setup Guide](_template/templates/yolo-mode-setup.md) for detailed configuration.

### Option 2: Interactive Mode (Ask First)

<!-- Uncomment this section and comment out YOLO mode if you prefer asking first:

**Ask before every significant operation.**

**Workflow**:
1. Ask "Should I [action]?" before creating files, installing packages, running commands
2. Wait for approval
3. Execute after receiving permission

This is the traditional, more cautious approach.

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Interactive Development
- Ask questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Understand the "why" behind requirements
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Batch related questions together
- In YOLO mode: Ask about destructive operations only

### 2. Security by Default
- Every feature gets a security review
- Never commit secrets or credentials (use environment variables)
- Think like a pentester: "How could this be exploited?"
- Consider both malicious users AND curious users
- Validate all inputs, sanitize all outputs
- Follow principle of least privilege

### 3. Test-Driven Development
- Write tests as you develop, not after
- Test business logic independently from UI
- Cover edge cases and error paths
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not just high percentages
- Integration tests for critical user flows

### 4. Clean Architecture
- Business logic separate from display logic
- Single responsibility principle
- Clear interfaces between layers
- Dependency injection where appropriate
- Make it work, make it right, make it fast (in that order)

### 5. Documentation First
- Document significant decisions in ADRs
- Explain complex logic with comments (the "why", not the "what")
- Keep README and setup docs current
- Document API contracts
- Update runbooks for operations

### 6. Clean Codebase
- Fix warnings, don't ignore them
- Refactor as you go
- Delete unused code
- Leave code better than you found it
- Consistent style throughout

### 7. Performance Awareness
- Profile before optimizing
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Use caching strategically
- Consider batch operations
- Monitor resource usage

### 8. Accessibility & Inclusion
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as default
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Semantic HTML
- Color contrast standards

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### [Add Your Custom Rules Here]

Example:
- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Mobile-first responsive design (breakpoints: 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px)
- Dark mode support required for all new features
- API responses must follow our standard envelope format
- All database queries must have indexes planned

### [Your Coding Patterns]

Example:
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic (React)
- Service layer for all business logic
- Repository pattern for database access
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts

### [Your Don'ts]

Example:
- Don't use `any` type in TypeScript
- Don't fetch data in components (use hooks/context)
- Don't bypass the ORM for raw SQL (except in migrations)
- Don't inline styles (use CSS modules or Tailwind)

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

**IMPORTANT**: All secrets and connection strings must be stored in `.env` (never commit this file!)

```bash
# Database Connection
# ALWAYS use this environment variable - never hardcode connection strings
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname

# API Keys
API_KEY=[your API key]
JWT_SECRET=[your JWT secret]

# See .env.example for complete list
```

**Agent Instructions**:
- Always reference `DATABASE_URL` from environment variables
- Never hardcode credentials or connection strings in code
- Use `.env` for local development
- Use platform-specific secrets management for production (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

### Database Schema Reference

**For agents**: To avoid syntax errors, always consult the schema before writing queries.

- **Current schema**: See `project/architecture/database-schema.sql` (or .md if documented)
- **Database type**: [e.g., PostgreSQL 15, MySQL 8, MongoDB 6]
- **ORM/Query Builder**: [e.g., Prisma, TypeORM, SQLAlchemy, none]
- **Migration tool**: [e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, Alembic, custom SQL files]

**Database-Specific Conventions** (customize for your database):

PostgreSQL Example:
- Use parameterized queries: `$1, $2, $3` not string concatenation
- JSONB for flexible metadata
- Array syntax: `ARRAY['val1', 'val2']` not `['val1', 'val2']`
- Always use `RETURNING` clause for INSERT/UPDATE when you need the result
- Single quotes for strings, double quotes for identifiers

**Migrations Location**: `[e.g., /migrations, /db/migrate, /prisma/migrations]`
- Never modify existing migrations - always create new ones
- Use sequential numbering: `001_initial.sql`, `002_add_users.sql`
- Test migrations against copy of production data before deploying

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
[your install command]

# Run database migrations
[your migration command, e.g., npm run migrate]

# Run development server
[your dev command]

# Run tests
[your test command]

# Run linter
[your lint command]
```

### Scratch Work & Testing

Use these directories for temporary work:
- `/temp/` - Temporary files and quick experiments (gitignored)
- `/scratch/` - Scratch work, throwaway code (gitignored)
- Both directories are safe for agents to use without affecting the codebase

## Deployment Process

[Document your deployment workflow]

Example:
1. Merge to `main` triggers CI
2. CI runs tests and builds
3. Auto-deploy to staging
4. Manual approval for production
5. Blue-green deployment to production
6. Smoke tests run automatically
7. Monitor logs and metrics

## Session Continuity

To maintain context across development sessions:

1. **Start of session**: Review this file and `project/features/backlog.md`
2. **During session**: Update feature status in real-time
3. **End of session**: Document decisions made, open questions, next steps
4. **Context file**: Create `project/session-notes.md` for handoff notes
