**Status:** [Planning | In Development | In Review | Testing | Deployed | Deprecated]

**Priority:** [High | Medium | Low]

**Target Release:** [Version/Sprint]

**Owner:** [Name or Team]

**Created:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Overview

### Problem Statement
**What problem are we solving?**

Describe the user pain point or business need. Be specific about who is affected and how.

Example:
> Users currently have to manually export data to Excel, manipulate it, and re-upload. This process takes 15-20 minutes per report and is error-prone. We need bulk editing capabilities directly in the interface.

### Proposed Solution
**What are we building?**

High-level description of the feature. Focus on the "what" not the "how".

Example:
> Add inline bulk editing with Excel-like keyboard navigation, allowing users to edit multiple rows without leaving the grid. Include undo/redo and validation.

### Success Criteria
**How will we know this feature is successful?**

Measurable outcomes:
- [ ] [Metric 1: e.g., Reduce report editing time by 50%]
- [ ] [Metric 2: e.g., 80% user adoption within 2 weeks]
- [ ] [Metric 3: e.g., Zero data corruption incidents]

## Design

### User Flow

```
1. User navigates to [page/section]
2. User clicks [action]
3. System displays [result]
4. User confirms [action]
5. System validates and saves
6. User sees [feedback]
```

**Alternative Flows:**
- **Error case:** If validation fails → show inline error → user corrects → retry
- **Edge case:** If no data → show empty state with helpful message
