- Better question frameworks
- Additional security patterns
- More comprehensive checklists
- Real-world examples

### 2. New Checklists
Create checklists for:
- New development phases
- Specific technology stacks
- Compliance requirements

### 3. Template Files
Add templates for:
- Common document types
- Project artifacts
- Communication formats

### 4. Script Enhancements
Improve automation:

- Additional features
- Cross-platform compatibility

### 5. Documentation

## Contribution Workflow

### From Your Project

If you've made improvements while working on a project:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd my-project

# 2. Make changes to template files in .claude/_template/
vim .claude/_template/agents/security.md

# 3. Test the changes in your project
# Verify they improve Claude's assistance

# 4. Use the contribute-back script
./scripts/contribute-back.sh .claude/_template/agents/security.md

# 5. The script creates a branch and opens PR dialog
# Create PR on GitHub
```

### Direct to Template Repo

For template-only improvements:

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository
gh repo fork yourorg/claude-sdlc-template

# 2. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b improvement/better-security-checklist

# 3. Make your changes
vim .claude/agents/security.md

# 4. Test in a sample project
cd ../test-project
./scripts/init-project.sh test-with-changes

# 5. Commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat(security): add API key rotation checklist"

# 6. Push and create PR
git push origin improvement/better-security-checklist
